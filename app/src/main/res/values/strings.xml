    <string name="biography">Born in January 11, 1994, I was born and raised in Brooklyn NY. My mother and father are devoted parents who
    have done a lot to raise me and without them I wouldn\'t be where I am at now. I enjoy coding and receiving more knowledge when not in class or at
    work. In the meantime when I am not studying I enjoy playing video games as well as playing with my kitten who helps relax me.</string>
